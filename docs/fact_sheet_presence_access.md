# Fact Sheet — Presence & Access

This document defines **presence**, **access**, and **scope** as they apply to diplomacy, incidents, and escalation.
It contains only factual rules.

---

## 1. Presence

### 1.1 What Presence Is

- Presence represents **physical or institutional representation** within a scope.
- Presence is provided by **agents or units**.
- Presence determines **what actions are legally possible**, not their outcome.

Presence never guarantees success; it only enables actions.

---

### 1.2 Presence Scopes

Presence is always tied to a scope:

- **Capital scope** – represents state-level diplomatic presence.
- **City scope** – represents local presence in a specific city.
- **Territorial scope** – represents physical presence in borders or contested areas.

Actions explicitly state which scope they require.

---

## 2. Access

### 2.1 What Access Is

- Access represents **permission to maintain presence** within a scope.
- Access is granted or denied via:
  - Treaties
  - Policies
  - Vassal or confederation rules

Without access, presence cannot be sustained.

---

### 2.2 Loss of Access

Access may be lost due to:
- Border closure
- Treaty expiry or breach
- Explicit expulsion actions

Loss of access never removes presence instantly.

---

## 3. Timed Removal ("Leave Now")

When access is revoked:

- All affected pieces enter a **timed removal state**.
- A fixed grace period is applied.
- During this period:
  - Pieces may move or withdraw normally.
  - Actions that require presence are restricted.

If the piece remains after the timer expires:
- Tension increases.
- An Incident may be created or escalated.

There is no teleportation or silent removal.

---

## 4. Diplomatic Presence

### 4.1 Diplomats

Diplomats provide **public diplomatic presence**.

#### Capital Presence

A diplomat in the capital is required to:
- Propose and sign **routine diplomatic deals**
- Maintain ongoing diplomatic contracts

These actions are not agenda-linked by default.

#### Local Presence

A diplomat in a relevant city or scope is required to:
- Create or escalate **Major Incidents**
- Issue binding demands tied to agendas or incidents
- Join incidents publicly

---

### 4.2 Missionaries

Missionaries provide **public ideological presence**.

- Require access to enter foreign territory (except vassal rules).
- Apply religious pressure within their city scope.
- Entry denial may create **Minor Incidents**.

Missionaries never provide diplomatic authority.

---

### 4.3 Spies

Spies provide **covert presence**.

- Do not require public access treaties.
- Operate only within a city scope.
- Enable espionage actions that increase Tension.

Spies cannot:
- Create Incidents directly
- Escalate Incidents to war

---

## 5. Military Presence

- Military units provide **coercive presence**.
- Military presence contributes to:
  - Tension
  - Relations (Military Power facet)

Military units do not grant diplomatic authority by themselves.

---

## 6. Authority vs Presence

- Presence enables actions.
- Authority determines **who may act**.

Examples:
- Overlords may act in vassal territory without local diplomats.
- Confederation rules may centralize foreign affairs.

Presence rules never override authority rules.

---

## 7. Action Requirements (Cross-Reference)

- Each action defines:
  - Required presence type
  - Required scope
  - Required access state

This document defines the framework, not the action list.

---

## 8. Invariants

- No action may occur without required presence.
- Loss of access never causes instant removal.
- Presence never guarantees outcomes.
- All presence and access states are visible and explainable.

If an action occurs without presence or access, it is invalid.
