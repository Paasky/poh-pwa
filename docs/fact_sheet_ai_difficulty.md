# Fact Sheet — AI Difficulty

This document defines **AI difficulty** as the set of rules that change how the AI uses the same information a human player has.
It contains only factual rules.

---

## 1. Core Principle

- AI difficulty never grants hidden information.
- AI difficulty changes:
  - how much the AI notices
  - how much the AI remembers
  - how far ahead the AI plans
  - how consistently the AI follows through

The AI and the player always operate on the same facts.

---

## 2. What Difficulty Controls

Difficulty controls four things.

### 2.1 Attention

- On lower difficulty, the AI focuses on only the most obvious pressures.
- On higher difficulty, the AI notices smaller shifts and earlier warning signs.

Attention affects:
- which scopes are considered urgent
- which changes in Relations and Tension trigger a response

---

### 2.2 Memory

- On lower difficulty, the AI forgets older behavior sooner.
- On higher difficulty, the AI retains longer histories.

Memory affects:
- how long past betrayals influence Trust
- how quickly the AI forgives consistent good behavior

---

### 2.3 Planning Horizon

- On lower difficulty, the AI prefers short-term plans.
- On higher difficulty, the AI forms longer preparations before committing publicly.

Planning horizon affects:
- how early the AI begins staging troops
- how early the AI builds pressure via agents
- how long it waits before declaring an agenda

---

### 2.4 Follow-Through

- On lower difficulty, the AI abandons plans more easily.
- On higher difficulty, the AI sticks to plans unless conditions change materially.

Follow-through affects:
- consistency in incident stances
- consistency in agenda pursuit
- consistency in regional priorities

---

## 3. Mechanical Effects (Where Difficulty Applies)

Difficulty may change:
- AI query breadth and depth
  - number of queries
  - number of results per query
  - distance or scope considered
- how many competing plans and priorities are evaluated
- how many regions are actively managed per tick

Difficulty does not change:
- legality of actions
- presence and access rules
- incident escalation rules
- the values of Influence or Faith

---

## 4. Explainability

- On any difficulty, AI decisions must remain explainable through:
  - Relations facets
  - Tension phases
  - Agendas and Incidents
  - Presence and Access

Lower difficulty produces fewer and later reactions, not different reasoning rules.

---

## 5. Invariants

- No hidden information at any difficulty.
- Difficulty affects attention, memory, planning horizon, and follow-through only.
- Difficulty never changes core diplomacy and escalation mechanics.

If difficulty changes outcomes without changing decisions, it is invalid.
