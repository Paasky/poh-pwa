# Fact Sheet — Influence & Faith (Diplomacy)

This document defines **Influence** and **Faith** strictly as they apply to diplomacy, incidents, agents, and agendas. It contains only factual rules. Other yields are out of scope.

---

## 1. What Influence Is

- Influence is a **yield** generated by specific buildings and effects.
- Influence is **stored** at the player level.
- Influence is spent to enable and sustain diplomatic activity.
- Influence behaves like other yields in storage and spending rules, but has diplomacy-specific sinks.

Influence exists to represent political capital, legitimacy, and the ability to exert pressure without force.

---

## 2. What Faith Is (Diplomacy-Relevant Scope)

- Faith is a **yield** generated by religious buildings and effects.
- Faith is **stored** at the player level.
- Faith is spent to enable and sustain **religious agents** and religious pressure.

Faith follows the same storage and starvation rules as Influence, but is consumed by different systems.

---

## 3. Storage and Spending

- Influence and Faith are accumulated each turn into player storage.
- Neither yield may go negative.
- When a rule requires spending or commitment:
  - The required amount is taken from storage.
  - If insufficient storage exists, starvation rules apply.

---

## 4. Ongoing Drains

### Influence Drains

Influence is continuously drained by:
- **Agendas**
- **Diplomatic agents** (Diplomats, Spies)
- **Committed incident stakes** (while incidents are unresolved)

### Faith Drains

Faith is continuously drained by:
- **Missionaries**
- Other religious systems (defined elsewhere)

Ongoing drains are evaluated every turn.

---

## 5. Agenda Influence Drain

- **Minor agendas** drain **20%** of influence output per turn.
- **Major agendas** drain **40%** of influence output per turn.
- Agenda drain has:
  - **Minimum**: 2 influence per turn
  - **No maximum**

Agenda drain is based on **current influence output**, not stored influence.

---

## 6. Committed Influence (Incidents)

- When an incident escalates, players may **commit influence**.
- Committed influence:
  - Is taken from player storage
  - Is reserved until the incident resolves
  - Cannot be used for other purposes while committed

On incident resolution, committed influence is:
- Returned
- Partially returned
- Lost
- Or transferred to another party

The exact outcome is determined by the incident poker resolution.

Committed influence is never created or destroyed arbitrarily.

---

## 7. Starvation Rules

Influence and Faith cannot go negative.

When storage is insufficient to cover ongoing drains:

### Influence Starvation Order

1. **Spies are removed**
2. **Diplomats are removed**
3. **Agendas are canceled** (if still insufficient)

### Faith Starvation Order

1. **Missionaries are removed**

Starvation resolution is:
- Deterministic
- Immediate
- Irreversible for the affected turn

---

## 8. Removal Effects

- Removing an agent immediately stops its effects.
- Canceling an agenda immediately stops its influence drain.
- No yield deficit is carried forward.

---

## 9. Transfers and Refunds

- Influence may only transfer between players via **incident resolution**.
- Faith does not transfer between players through diplomatic systems.
- Refunds apply only to **committed influence**, never to agenda or agent upkeep already paid.

---

## 10. Invariants

- Influence and Faith never go negative.
- All drains and commitments are visible and explainable.
- There is no hidden creation or deletion of either yield.
- If a diplomatic outcome cannot be explained by these rules, it is invalid.
