Switzerland consolidated its cantons under a federal constitution in 1848 and refined it by referendum and consensus practice. The Federal Republic of Germany rebuilt federalism after 1949 through the Basic Law and cooperative institutions. India formed a union of states after 1947, reorganizing linguistic boundaries and developing strong emergency provisions to manage diversity and crisis.",

Revolutionary France moved through successive republican constitutions and expanded civic participation. The Weimar Republic attempted liberal democracy under proportional representation but faced polarization and crisis.

    "description": "Mercantilism was an early modern doctrine that sought national power through controlled commerce and bullion accumulation. States granted monopolies to chartered companies, enforced navigation laws, and exploited colonies for raw materials. Spain drew silver and gold from the Americas to fund imperial commitments. England used the Navigation Acts and the East India Company to channel trade through English ships and ports. The Dutch VOC secured Asian spices under state-backed privileges. Mercantilism financed fleets and wars and aided state formation. Classical economists later criticized it for restraining competition and misallocating resources.",

It spreads risk and reduces exposure to embargoes. The Soviet Union pursued planning and import substitution across heavy industry. Post‑independence India favored protected markets and licensing during the 1950s–1970s. North Korea’s Juche doctrine pushed extreme self‑reliance, with chronic shortages. Autarky can build capacities in defense and essentials. It often imposes high costs through inefficiency, limited technology transfer, and constrained consumer choice.",

The Qing dynasty’s Canton System confined European commerce to a single port with licensed intermediaries. The United States adopted neutrality laws and avoided entangling alliances in the interwar years. Isolation can stabilize regimes and reduce external entanglements. It can also slow innovation and leave states unprepared for systemic shocks.",

After 1979, Iran institutionalized clerical oversight, Islamic courts, and religious vetting of officials. Taliban administrations enforced conservative dress codes, gender segregation, and religious schooling. Supporters frame the order as faithful restoration. Critics record curtailed civil liberties and suppression of minority sects. Outcomes depend on local institutions, clerical authority, and external pressure.",

Authoritarian religious councils have issued binding interpretations and sanctioned rivals. Dogmatism narrows debate, reduces experimental policy, and entrenches patronage networks. Stability can increase in the short term. Long-term effects often include intellectual stagnation, underground opposition, and brittle legitimacy when crises expose contradictions.",

The state funds clergy, regulates doctrine, and often links officeholding to religious conformity.

Lutheran state churches in Scandinavia shaped schooling, parish records, and welfare provision. The Ottoman Empire structured administration through Islamic law and a millet system for recognized minorities. Modern constitutions may retain establishment while expanding civil rights.

Early precedents include the Edict of Nantes, which granted restricted toleration to French Protestants, and the pluralist Dutch Republic after the Reformation. The U.S. First Amendment created a durable model combining nonestablishment with free exercise. Contemporary secular constitutions protect minority communities and enable voluntary institutions. Implementation varies. Some states retain blasphemy laws or registration regimes that burden small groups.

During the French Revolution, dechristianization and civic cults challenged clerical power before later settlements.
